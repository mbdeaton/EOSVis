EOSVis: Repository of EOS visualization data, made from EOS tables used in SpEC

This is meant to live in an EsOS dir, representing TOV sequences, stellar profiles,
and thermodynamic quantities along various slices of the EsOS in ../. Most of the *.dats
in here are generated with executables from Hydro/EquationOfState/Executables/.

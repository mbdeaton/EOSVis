EOSVis: Repository of EOS visualization data, made from EOS tables used in SpEC

*** OVERVIEW ****************************************************************************
This repo mainly contains *dats and scripts to plot those *dats. These *dats represent TOV
sequences, stellar profiles, and thermodynamic quantities along various slices of the EsOS
available in /ds04/sxs/mbdeaton/EsOS. Most of the *dats here are generated with
executables from $SPECHOME/Hydro/EquationOfState/Executables.

Find plotting scripts in gnuplotscripts.

I usually put this repo inside of my EsOS dir, and make sure that I my rsyncEOS script
ignores the EOSVis dir.

*** GLOSSARY ****************************************************************************
maketovsequence-*dat
	TOV sequences generated from exec MakeTOVSequence. More stellar data for each
	star along the sequence is in the corresponding *out file.
ploteos-*dat
	Thermodynamic quantities along EOS slices from exec PlotEOS.
